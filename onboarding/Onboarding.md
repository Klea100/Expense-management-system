# What We Expect from Developers 🚀 [PLEASE READ]

## Save the Startup You Work For 🛠️
It’s okay to make mistakes—what's not cool is repeating them. We’ve seen certain issues come up over and over again, so we put together a little guide to help you avoid those same struggles. Check out some of those stories: [link].

## Write Boring Code 😴
In our startup studio, most projects will need to pivot at some point. This means that your perfectly crafted, clean, and well-tested code will likely be thrown out 95% of the time. So instead of spending too much time trying to optimize, we focus on **simplicity and consistency**.

We believe it's better to take a few extra minutes to simplify code and features upfront, rather than spend days overengineering something that won’t add business value. **Iteration is key** 🔄.

We also expect developers to challenge the features being requested and make sure they’re done right. Our job is to give startups enough runway to find their Product Market Fit (PMF) and keep growing 🌱.

## Code for Readability 👓
The ratio of time spent reading versus writing code is well over 10 to 1 📚. You'll spend more time reading old code than writing new code.

Think about the next person who’ll read your function—likely while debugging a nasty issue 🐛 that touches five other functions just like it. For their sake, stop writing smart, overly elaborate code that only you can understand. Instead, write **simple, readable code**. This is what makes a great developer 🌟.

Ask yourself:
- Would a less experienced developer understand how this code works?
- Would a less informed developer grasp what this code does?

Keep it simple and always get feedback to stay on track ✅.

## Be Pragmatic 💡
Take Instagram as an example: they had only ~10 engineers when they were acquired for $1B by Facebook. How? They were **pragmatic**.

Always think ahead, but don’t implement everything upfront. **Over-optimization will kill you!** 🚫 Instagram’s CTO, Mike Krieger, mentioned that they were running a simple Python/Django web app in production—and it was good enough 🐍.

So, forget about your 10 microservices communicating via gRPC if you only have 2 clients. Don’t optimize until it’s necessary. Why focus on perfecting your system when the product might not even work, or the company could die tomorrow? 💀

You’ll never have enough engineers to solve all the technical challenges raised, but that’s fine. Only a few are important, so focus on those. Speed optimization can wait ⏳.

## Think Business 💼
Every time you log your hours in Accounting, it directly impacts the bill we send to the client 💸. For example, if the client pays €300 per day and you record 4 hours of work on their project, they’ll be billed €150 at the end of the month. 

The time you spend working has a direct financial impact on the client, so choose wisely how you spend it 💡. The most important thing for a company is ROI—Return on Investment 📈. The money earned has to be higher than the money spent.
