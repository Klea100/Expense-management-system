# DELEGATION: Balance Skills and Costs

Delegation is about getting things done without wearing yourself out. It’s about knowing when to let others do tasks and when to do them yourself. When done right, it helps the team work better, builds up skills, and helps you do more in less time.

### Three Basic Principles:
1. **Work together well**: Make sure everyone does their fair share.
2. **Build individual strengths**: Help each person improve.
3. **Get things done smartly**: Use your resources wisely.

### When to Delegate
- **When you have too much work**: If you’re overloaded, pass tasks to others. Focus on the tasks that give the most value to you and the team.
- **When you can save money**: If someone else can do the job for less, delegate. Just make sure not to give away too many tasks and increase costs. Find the right balance.

## The Rules of Delegation

### 1. What Should You Delegate?
- **As much as possible**. The goal is to slowly reduce your own tasks. But this is not easy, and it will take time.

**Example**:

### 2. Set Expectations with Your Boss
Your boss is important here, not just your team. They need to feel you’re in control. Keep them updated. You are managing your boss just as much as you are managing your team.

Let them know:
- Important tasks will be done.
- Where mistakes could happen and how you plan to fix them.

**Example**:

---

### 3. Set Expectations with Yourself
The person you delegate to won’t do things exactly as you do. That’s okay.

- Five people doing 80% of your work equals 400% output.
- Be honest with yourself:
  - If a task must be done by you, keep it.
  - If you feel bad about delegating, ask yourself why.
  - If you can’t delegate anything, something else is wrong.

**Example**:

### 4. Delegate for Your Own Growth
To improve, you need time and space. That’s why delegating is important.

Focus on:
- Partially delegated tasks that still need finishing.
- Tasks where you don’t add much value.
- Repetitive tasks that could be automated or written down.

**Example**:

---

### 5. Delegate for Their Growth
Help your team improve by giving them challenging tasks.

- Ask them what they want to learn and grow in.
- Give them responsibility for their development.

**Example**:

---

### 6. Set Expectations with Your Team
Delegation isn’t just giving tasks. It should be clear, written down, and focused on goals.

- Spend time upfront setting things up to avoid fixing mistakes later.

**Example**:

### 7. The Steps of Delegation
Once you’ve set goals and provided resources, think about delegation as steps:

1. **Steps over tasks**: Delegate instructions and small actions, not just individual tasks.
2. **Processes over steps**: After they can handle actions, give them control of entire processes.
3. **Responsibilities over processes**: Let them take charge of bigger areas.
4. **Goals over responsibilities**: Hold them accountable for overall results, not just tasks.
5. **Jobs over goals**: Eventually, give full roles to people you trust.

Each step gives you more time and helps the team grow.

### 8. Watch Out For
- **Delegating and disappearing**: Don’t use delegation as a way to escape. Check on things regularly to avoid bad surprises.
  - *Example*: Deb on StudioMap. Don’t abandon it. Make sure things are running smoothly.

- **Micromanaging**: This is usually because you’re nervous, not because they’re not trying. Focus on helping and checking progress.

**Example**:

### 10. Bonus: Advanced Delegation
Make sure you’ve mastered the basics before trying this. When you’re ready, explore more advanced delegation methods for even greater efficiency.
