# Don't Try Optimizing Too Soon

## Premature Optimization Is the Root of All Evil

Premature optimization is spending a lot of time on something that you may not actually need. One of the biggest challenges is making sure we are making good use of our time. The more confidence you have that you are building the right things, the more time you should put into proper software architecture, performance, scalability, etc. Striking this balance is always the challenge. Like most things in life, the answer is almost always "it depends."

The performance and scalability of your application are important. You just need to make sure you are building the right feature set first. Avoid premature optimization by getting user feedback early and often from your users.

### If you want a rule of thumb, here it is:

1. **The First Rule of Program Optimization:** Don't do it.
2. **The Second Rule of Program Optimization (for experts only!):** Don't do it yet.

The ancient tradition is that you don't optimize until you've profiled â€” that is, until you have hard evidence as to what actually needs to be optimized.
