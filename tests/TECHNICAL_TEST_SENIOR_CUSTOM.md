# Selego Technical Assessment - Senior Developer
## Full-Stack Developer Position (Senior Level)

**Time Allocation:** 2-3 hours maximum  
**Stack:** React (frontend) + Node.js/Express (backend) + MongoDB

---

## The Challenge

You're building a **smart contract management platform**. Law firms need to analyze contracts, extract key information, and get AI-powered insights to make better decisions.

**Your mission:** Build a system that demonstrates senior-level thinking in:
1. **AI Integration Architecture** - Beyond basic chatbots, show real AI problem-solving
2. **Client-Ready Code** - Code quality that you'd confidently present to clients
3. **Independent Decision Making** - Make architectural choices and justify them
4. **Technical Leadership** - Show patterns other developers could follow

**What we're really testing:**
- Can you architect AI solutions that solve real business problems?
- Can you write code that inspires confidence in clients and team members?
- Can you work independently and make smart trade-offs under pressure?
- Do you think like a senior developer who can guide technical decisions?

## What to Build

### Core System

**Contracts Management:**
- Upload and store contract documents (PDF/text)
- Extract and display contract metadata
- Track contract status and important dates

**AI-Powered Analysis (This is the key test):**
Choose **TWO** of these AI features to implement:

#### Option A: Contract Intelligence
- **Extract key terms** (parties, dates, amounts, clauses)
- **Risk assessment** - AI identifies potential legal risks
- **Compliance checking** - Flag contracts that don't meet company standards

#### Option B: Smart Recommendations  
- **Similar contract matching** - Find contracts with similar terms
- **Pricing analysis** - AI suggests if contract terms are favorable
- **Amendment suggestions** - AI recommends contract improvements

#### Option C: Advanced Document Processing
- **Multi-document analysis** - Compare multiple contracts simultaneously  
- **Trend analysis** - AI identifies patterns across contract portfolio
- **Auto-categorization** - Smart tagging and organization of contracts

**Why this tests real AI skills:**
- Requires understanding of document processing, not just chat
- Tests ability to structure complex AI workflows
- Shows judgment in choosing appropriate AI models/approaches
- Demonstrates handling of real-world data complexity

### Technical Requirements

**Backend Architecture:**
- RESTful API with proper error handling
- File upload and processing pipeline
- AI service integration with fallback strategies
- Database design for complex document relationships

**Frontend Experience:**
- Document upload with progress indicators
- AI results display with confidence levels
- Interactive contract analysis dashboard
- Professional UI that you'd demo to a client

**Integration & Services:**
- **AI Service** - OpenAI, Anthropic, or your choice
- **Email Notifications** - Contract deadline alerts
- **File Storage** - Handle document uploads securely

## Evaluation Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Client Demo
*"You need to demo this to a law firm partner in 30 minutes. They're technical enough to ask good questions but want to see real value."*

**What this tests:**
- Is your UI professional and intuitive?
- Can you explain your AI choices confidently?
- Does the system actually work reliably?
- Would you feel confident presenting this?

### Scenario 2: Team Handoff
*"A junior developer needs to add a new contract type. Can they understand and extend your code?"*

**What this tests:**
- Code organization and documentation
- Consistent patterns and naming
- Service layer abstraction
- Configuration management

### Scenario 3: Production Readiness
*"The client wants to deploy this next week. What needs to happen?"*

**What this tests:**
- Environment configuration
- Error handling and monitoring
- Security considerations
- Scalability planning

## Questions & Support

**Q: Which AI features should I choose?**
A: Pick the ones that interest you most or that you think would be most valuable. We want to see your judgment and technical approach.

**Q: How sophisticated should the AI be?**
A: Focus on solid implementation over complexity. A well-architected simple feature beats a broken complex one.

**Q: What if AI services are unreliable during development?**
A: Handle it gracefully and document the issue. This is exactly what we want to see - real-world resilience.

**Q: How much should I focus on UI vs backend?**
A: Balance both, but prioritize functionality and code quality. The UI should be professional but doesn't need to be pixel-perfect.
