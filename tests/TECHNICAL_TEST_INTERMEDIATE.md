## Full-Stack Developer Position (2-4 Years Experience)

**Time Allocation:** 2.5-3 hours maximum  
**Stack:** React (frontend) + Node.js/Express (backend) + MongoDB

## The Problem

You're building a **team expense management system**. Companies need to track expenses across different teams, manage budgets per team, and get insights into spending patterns.

**Your job:** Build a working system that lets users:
1. Create and manage teams with individual budgets
2. Add expenses to specific teams
3. Track spending against team budgets
4. Send email alerts when teams exceed their budgets
5. Add one AI-powered feature for expense insights

**What we're testing:**
- Can you design normalized data relationships?
- Can you build clean, scalable APIs?
- Can you integrate multiple external services efficiently?
- Can you implement business logic with proper validation?
- Can you balance feature completeness with time constraints?

---

## What to Build

### Backend

Build an API that handles:
- **Teams** - with names, budgets, and members
- **Expenses** - linked to teams, with categories and approval status
- **Budget monitoring** - track spending vs. budget per team
- **Email notifications** - when teams exceed budget thresholds

**Service Integrations (Required):**

#### 1. Email Service
Send budget alerts when a team's expenses exceed 80% and 100% of their budget.

**Recommended Options:**
- [Brevo/Sendinblue](https://www.brevo.com) - Free tier, good API
- [Resend](https://resend.com) - Developer-friendly
- [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com) - Reliable choice

#### 2. AI Integration
Add **one AI-powered feature** to enhance the expense management:

**Choose one:**
- **Smart categorization** - AI suggests expense categories based on description
- **Budget forecasting** - AI predicts if team will exceed budget based on current trends
- **Expense validation** - AI flags potentially duplicate or suspicious expenses
- **Spending insights** - AI provides brief analysis of team spending patterns

**AI Service Options:**
- [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com) - GPT models
- [Anthropic Claude](https://www.anthropic.com) - Alternative to GPT
- [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) - Multiple models

**We want to see:**
- Clean service layer architecture
- Proper error handling for external APIs
- Secure API key management
- Smart integration points (when to call AI vs when not to)

### Frontend

Build a React interface with:
- **Team dashboard** - showing budget status for each team
- **Expense management** - add/edit/delete expenses per team
- **Budget alerts** - visual indicators when teams are over/near budget
- **AI insights** - display results from your chosen AI feature
- **Basic filtering** - by team, date range, or category

**Technical expectations:**
- Component organization and reusability
- State management (local state is fine, but show good patterns)
- Error handling for API calls
- Loading states for async operations

### Data Design

Design your own schemas, but consider:
- How to efficiently query expenses by team
- How to calculate budget utilization
- How to handle expense categories
- Whether to store calculated totals or compute them

**Hint:** Think about query patterns and data consistency.

---

## Technical Requirements

### Follow These Principles

1. **API Design** - RESTful conventions with consistent responses
   ```javascript
   // âœ… Good API structure
   GET    /api/teams              - List all teams
   GET    /api/teams/:id          - Get team details
   POST   /api/teams              - Create team
   GET    /api/teams/:id/expenses - Get team expenses
   POST   /api/expenses           - Create expense
   ```

2. **Error Handling** - Graceful failures with proper status codes
   ```javascript
   // âœ… Good error handling
   try {
     const result = await emailService.sendAlert(team, budget);
     if (!result.success) {
       console.error('Email failed:', result.error);
       // Continue processing, don't crash
     }
   } catch (error) {
     console.error('Email service error:', error);
   }
   ```

3. **Service Layer** - Separate business logic from routes
   ```javascript
   // âœ… Good separation
   // routes/expenses.js
   router.post('/', async (req, res) => {
     const result = await expenseService.createExpense(req.body);
     return res.status(result.status).json(result);
   });
   
   // services/expenseService.js
   const createExpense = async (expenseData) => {
     // validation, business logic, database operations
   };
   ```

4. **Data Validation** - Validate inputs and handle edge cases
   ```javascript
   // âœ… Good validation
   const expenseSchema = {
     teamId: { type: ObjectId, required: true },
     amount: { type: Number, required: true, min: 0.01 },
     description: { type: String, required: true, trim: true },
     category: { type: String, enum: ['travel', 'food', 'supplies', 'other'] }
   };
   ```

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How complex should the AI feature be?**  
A: Keep it simple but functional. A working basic feature is better than a complex broken one. Focus on clean integration patterns.

**Q: Should I use TypeScript?**  
A: Use what you're most productive with. We care more about code quality than the specific language variant.

**Q: How much validation do I need?**  
A: Basic validation for required fields and data types. Don't spend too much time on complex validation rules.

**Q: What if external services fail during development?**  
A: Handle it gracefully in your code and document the issue. We understand external dependencies can be unreliable.

**Q: Should I deploy the application?**  
A: Not required, but if you can do it quickly and it doesn't take away from core functionality, it's a nice touch.

**Q: How detailed should my API documentation be?**  
A: Include endpoints, expected request/response formats, and any important notes. A simple table or list is fine.
