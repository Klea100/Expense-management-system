# The Empty Fridge 🥶

We had **50K euros** to build an app that scans your fridge and gives you recipe suggestions 🍲. Success? Simple: **100 onboarded users**. We kicked off by diving straight into the tech, exploring all kinds of fancy scanner technologies 🔍. But here’s the kicker—GPT-4 image recognition didn’t launch as early as we hoped 🕰️, so we scrambled to find alternatives, eventually landing on a tool called **Logmeal**.

But then, reality hit 💥. We had spent so much time on tech that the app itself looked… well, **ugly** 😬. So, we shifted focus to UX/UI 🎨. Fast forward a month and a half, **30K euros** down the drain, and still, **zero onboarded users**. Even worse, the team hadn’t learned a thing 🤷‍♂️.

# Picture This! 🎬

We had **16K euros** to build an internal app for channel managers. This time, we worked side by side with the user who had been doing the process manually for the past year 📋. Whenever they asked for a complex feature, we always stopped to ask: **Why?** 🤔. 

In most cases, there was a **simpler solution** to achieve the same goal 🎯. The result? **30 daily users** were happy, posting over **3,000 videos**, and regularly sending us thank you messages 🙌. Oh, and bonus point: this startup raised **100M euros** a few weeks later 💰.

# Micro Nightmare 😱

We walked into a **mess**. There were **5 developers**, **2 product managers**, too many **microservices**, and countless repositories 🧩. The worst part? **Zero users** 🚫. 

The CEO was obsessed with features 📋. They wouldn’t push for acquisition because they felt the app didn’t have enough “cool” features. Yet, nothing took less than 3 days to build and nothing was pushed to production unless it was "pretty enough" 💄. 

Communication was practically nonexistent 🗨️. The only voice in the channel was the product manager's. Developers? Silent. No one knew what anyone else was doing 🤐. Feedback wasn’t welcomed, so everyone just… shut up.

# Good CEOs Exist 💡

But they need our execution 🛠️.

We walked into a different kind of project—one that was also a mess, with tons of **microservices** and **repositories**. Over **400K euros** had been burned 💸 with a tech agency. Luckily, this CEO got it. They understood that costs were sunk and let us **start from scratch** 🧑‍💻.

They focused on **acquisition** 📈, clearly communicated changes in the public channels 🗣️, and trusted the team. Developers knew exactly where we were headed and even began **driving the backlog** themselves 🏎️. They didn’t need hand-holding or a Figma file to move forward. They asked tough questions about pricing, next steps, and features 💬. 

The developers were curious, proactive, and **part of the success** 🤝. Three months later? We hit **4K monthly revenue** and it’s only going up! 🚀
